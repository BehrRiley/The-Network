# Rat Pits
Players can train their cats to be a wily cat in these arenas of battle between cats and mice.

## Travel & Location
There are four rat pits, and only allow certain types of cats to participate :

- Varrock (cats) - Hooknosed Jack
- Ardougne (kittens) - Jimmy Dazzler
- Keldagrim (overgrown cats) - Smokin' Joe
- Port Sarim (wily cats) - The Face

### How to Play
What to bring:
- A Cat (the rat pit you go to relies on your cat type)
- Rat pole (suggested)
- Catspeak amulet (Lets one use a strategy. Without it, one's cat will fight to the death.)

### Rules
There are four pits. The first one, found in Ardougne, will only allow kittens. The Varrock one will only allow cats. The third one, located in Keldagrim, only allows overgrown cats. Finally, the Port Sarim rat pit will only allow wily cats. As lazy cats are not allowed, one will have to train it to become wily again before it is allowed.

A bet must be placed. The minimum allowed is 100 coins, maximum is 50,000. Both players' bets must be the same before the game will begin. If the player has a catspeak amulet, they can tell the cat which strategy to use:

| Dialogue Option | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| None (no catspeak amulet) | The cat's stats are unchanged. In addition, the cat will fight until it dies, in which case the player would lose both the fight and the cat. |
| Just be careful in there cat. | The cat's defence and hitpoints are greatly increased, but greatly lowers attack and strength. In addition, the cat will run away from the fight (and lose) when its health drops too low. |
| Stay in for as long as you can. | The cat's defence and hitpoints are increased, but lowers attack and strength. In addition, the cat will run away from the fight (and lose) when its health drops too low. |
| No guts, no glory! | The cat's attack and strength are increased, but lowers defence and hitpoints. In addition, the cat will fight until it dies, in which case the player would lose both the fight and the cat. |
| Go berserk! | The cat's attack and strength are greatly increased, but greatly lowers defence and hitpoints. In addition, the cat will fight until it dies, in which case the player would lose both the fight and the cat. |

Once the bets have been placed and the strategies chosen, the cats begin to kill rats. The number of rats that need to be killed before a cat wins depends on the type of cat. If a cat runs away or dies, the owner of the cat will lose the bet. However, as said before, the cat will only be lost if it dies. In the case that both cats tire out at the same amount of kills, the match is declared a draw and both cats and bets are returned to their owners.

### Rewards
The game only has one reward - coins. As there is no other reward and items cannot be bet, there is not much popularity towards the game.
