## Gameplay
The aim of the game is to take the enemy's standard (flag) from their castle and return it to the standard in your own castle, gaining one point each time. You must prevent the opposing team from taking your flag by blocking them from your castle (place barricades, lock doors or collapse tunnels underground), or by killing them. Slain players will respawn in the starting area within the game, so both sides are constantly fighting with a near (if not totally) equal numbered team. This is a safe game, so if you die, you will not lose items. Each game lasts for 10-20 minutes, and the team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner. You will gain three Castle wars tickets if your team wins, two tickets if the game ends in a draw, and one ticket if your team loses. AFK gameplay in games can be penalized removing tickets entirely for the game. You will not gain more tickets if you kill another player or score a point, but MVP status and in-game stats can be recorded for records and Hi-scores type stuff. Castle wars tickets are redeemable for a number of decorative armours and other rewards. For having more success in Castle Wars, it is better to have a higher Combat level, but lower level players can focus on the defensive measures mentioned below.

### Restrictions
The only items allowed inside the Castle Wars area are potions, runes, and Combat-related items such as armour â€” with the exception of helmets, hats, scarves and capes. Food cannot be brought in, but healing potions can be obtained within the arena, which are used to heal players in the same way as food. Lunar spells such as Heal Other and Cure Me can not be used during the game. The Dwarf multicannon cannot be brought into Castle Wars. Pets cannot be brought into the mini-game.

Since this is a safe mini-game, players do not have to worry about dying because they will not lose their items. Unlike the Duel Arena, arrows will not be returned after each match. It is the player's responsibility to pick up any projectiles fired if they choose to do so. However, if Ava's device is used on Lanthus before a player enters the game, he will collect ammunition for the player (Since you can't wear it inside).

Also, if players are wearing armours or Prayer symbols/books of the three gods (Saradomin, Guthix, Zamorak), they will have strange effects on the wearer if they enter the wrong portal. Saradomin will turn a player into a rabbit if they are wearing a Zamorak or Guthix symbol or armour when entering his portal; Guthix will turn them into a sheep if they are wearing a Saradomin or Zamorak symbol or armour upon entering its portal; and Zamorak will turn them into an imp if they are wearing a Saradomin or Guthix symbol or armour when entering his portal. Players transformed into a rabbit, sheep or imp cannot perform any tasks. They also cannot view menu screens other than private and public chat, music and settings. However, when the waiting period elapses and the game starts, the player will be turned back to normal.

### The Castles
The large square formation covering most of the map is the actual arena. Inside the arena there are two smaller castles, one for each team. There are four levels to a castle. The 1st floor has two outer walls facing into the arena, one with a large door that can be attacked and broken down (or barricaded by the defending team) and another with a smaller door that can be pick-locked (or locked by the defending team). The battlements on the 1st floor are accessible via a staircase near the small door, and there is a catapult on top of the outer wall. Within the walls, there is a staircase leading to the battlements, a staircase leading to the second level, a ladder leading to the second level, and a ladder leading to the underground passages. There are tables where climbing ropes, rocks, barricades, pickaxes, toolboxes, and explosive potions are attainable. There is a tap, two bucket respawns, and a tinderbox respawn. When players die, they are returned to a respawn room in the appropriate castle.

#### Second level
The 2nd floor contains a passage bent at a right angle, enveloping that team's spawn room, which is only accessible to the castle's team. There is a staircase leading to the next level. Inside the spawn room, there is a bandage table, a tinderbox respawn, a ladder leading to the next level, and a portal to leave the current game. If any player does so, players on the same team in the waiting room will be asked if they wish to join the current game. The first to accept takes the previous player's space.

#### Third level
The 3rd floor has a small inside wall enveloping a trapdoor that leads down to that castle's spawn room. The trapdoor is only usable by that castle's team. There is a one-square-wide passage around this wall. A staircase leading to the highest level is located against one of the walls.

#### Fourth level
The highest floor contains only a standard stand, which may or may not hold that castle's team's standard, depending on whether the enemy team has taken the standard or not.

#### Underground
The underground passage level can be accessed by two ladders in the middle of the arena or by a ladder from either team's castle. Either castle's ladder is located at opposite ends of the underground area, each with two passages towards the central cavern. At the mouth (facing the centre area) of each passage, there is a deposit of rocks which may be removed or replaced with explosive potions or pickaxes. The central area is a small castle that has two ladders leading up to the centre of the arena's ground level. This area can be used for ranging and maging.

### Rewards
The following ticket rewards for each game scenario are as follows:

Shut-out win (1-0) = 3 tickets to winning team, 1 ticket for losing team.
Regular win (2-1) = 2 tickets to the winning team, 1 ticket for losing team.
Scoreless tie (0-0) = 2 tickets for both teams.
Regular tie (1-1) = 1 ticket for both teams.
15 minutes spent in the game is required to earn tickets.

## Development Notes
- Map will actually be instanced, separate from the Gielinor World to regulate server TPS & to sustain a focus for maximum performance in the mini-game itself.
- NPCs can be used to fixate player count, replace AFK players, or create completely observable games that players can make bets on.
- Tickets should be track-able - god forbid we actually lose them if they exist someplace.
