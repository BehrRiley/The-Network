# Castle Wars

## Description
It is similar to Capture the Flag, but with a RuneScape twist.

### Travel & Location
Castle Wars is found in the south-west corner of Kandarin and may be accessed via a number of ways:

Literally walking there in the Gielinor World.
Using a ring of dueling to teleport directly there.
Travelling west from Yanille or Gu'Tanoth.
The Balloon transport system has an end point just north-east of the entrance.
Walking south-west from Ardougne.
Going to the mini-games tab, and selecting Castle Wars and using the mini-game teleport.
The fairy ring code bkp is just south of Castle Wars.
Clan Wars portal

## Gameplay
The aim of the game is to take the enemy's standard (flag) from their castle and return it to the standard in your own castle, gaining one point each time. You must prevent the opposing team from taking your flag by blocking them from your castle (place barricades, lock doors or collapse tunnels underground), or by killing them. Slain players will respawn in the starting area within the game, so both sides are constantly fighting with a near (if not totally) equal numbered team. This is a safe game, so if you die, you will not lose items. Each game lasts for 10-20 minutes, and the team with the most points at the end of the game is declared the winner. You will gain three Castle wars tickets if your team wins, two tickets if the game ends in a draw, and one ticket if your team loses. AFK gameplay in games can be penalized removing tickets entirely for the game. You will not gain more tickets if you kill another player or score a point, but MVP status and in-game stats can be recorded for records and Hi-scores type stuff. Castle wars tickets are redeemable for a number of decorative armours and other rewards. For having more success in Castle Wars, it is better to have a higher Combat level, but lower level players can focus on the defensive measures mentioned below.

### Restrictions
The only items allowed inside the Castle Wars area are potions, runes, and Combat-related items such as armour — with the exception of helmets, hats, scarves and capes. Food cannot be brought in, but healing potions can be obtained within the arena, which are used to heal players in the same way as food. Lunar spells such as Heal Other and Cure Me can not be used during the game. The Dwarf multicannon cannot be brought into Castle Wars. Pets cannot be brought into the mini-game.

Since this is a safe mini-game, players do not have to worry about dying because they will not lose their items. Unlike the Duel Arena, arrows will not be returned after each match. It is the player's responsibility to pick up any projectiles fired if they choose to do so. However, if Ava's device is used on Lanthus before a player enters the game, he will collect ammunition for the player (Since you can't wear it inside).

Also, if players are wearing armours or Prayer symbols/books of the three gods (Saradomin, Guthix, Zamorak), they will have strange effects on the wearer if they enter the wrong portal. Saradomin will turn a player into a rabbit if they are wearing a Zamorak or Guthix symbol or armour when entering his portal; Guthix will turn them into a sheep if they are wearing a Saradomin or Zamorak symbol or armour upon entering its portal; and Zamorak will turn them into an imp if they are wearing a Saradomin or Guthix symbol or armour when entering his portal. Players transformed into a rabbit, sheep or imp cannot perform any tasks. They also cannot view menu screens other than private and public chat, music and settings. However, when the waiting period elapses and the game starts, the player will be turned back to normal.

### The Castles & Ground Level
The large square formation covering most of the map is the actual arena. Inside the arena there are two smaller castles, one for each team. There are four levels to a castle. The 1st floor has two outer walls facing into the arena, one with a large door that can be attacked and broken down (or barricaded by the defending team) and another with a smaller door that can be pick-locked (or locked by the defending team). The battlements on the 1st floor are accessible via a staircase near the small door, and there is a catapult on top of the outer wall. Within the walls, there is a staircase leading to the battlements, a staircase leading to the second level, a ladder leading to the second level, and a ladder leading to the underground passages. There are tables where climbing ropes, rocks, barricades, pickaxes, toolboxes, and explosive potions are attainable. There is a tap, two bucket respawns, and a flint & steel respawn. When players die, they are returned to a respawn room in the appropriate castle.

#### Second level
The 2nd floor contains a passage bent at a right angle, enveloping that team's spawn room, which is only accessible to the castle's team. There is a staircase leading to the next level. Inside the spawn room, there is a potion table, a flint & steel respawn, a ladder leading to the next level, and a portal to leave the current game. If any player does so, players on the same team in the waiting room will be asked if they wish to join the current game. The first to accept takes the previous player's space.

#### Third level
The 3rd floor has a small inside wall enveloping a trapdoor that leads down to that castle's spawn room. The trapdoor is only usable by that castle's team. There is a one-square-wide passage around this wall. A staircase leading to the highest level is located against one of the walls.

#### Fourth level
The highest floor contains only a standard stand, which may or may not hold that castle's team's standard, depending on whether the enemy team has taken the standard or not.

#### Underground
The underground passage level can be accessed by two ladders in the middle of the arena or by a ladder from either team's castle. Either castle's ladder is located at opposite ends of the underground area, each with two passages towards the central cavern. At the mouth (facing the centre area) of each passage, there is a deposit of rocks which may be removed or replaced with explosive potions or pickaxes. The central area is a small castle that has two ladders leading up to the centre of the arena's ground level. This area can be used for ranging and maging.

### Rewards
The following ticket rewards for each game scenario are as follows:

Shut-out win (1-0) = 3 tickets to winning team, 1 ticket for losing team.
Regular win (2-1) = 2 tickets to the winning team, 1 ticket for losing team.
Scoreless tie (0-0) = 2 tickets for both teams.
Regular tie (1-1) = 1 ticket for both teams.
15 minutes spent in the game is required to earn tickets.

Some special, notable rewards:
Saradomin halo	75 - tickets
Zamorak halo 75 - tickets
Guthix halo 75 - tickets
Red, White, Gold armor sets
Ranged Gold Armor set

### Special Features of the Arena
#### The Catapult
One catapult is located in each teams castle. Players may use the catapult if they have ammo, which they can obtain from tables on the 2nd floor. After players have ammo, they can operate the catapult by clicking on it. A display will open up and players must then choose the X and Y coordinates of where they wish to fire; however, often, the shot will not go exactly where you aim. The highest X and Y coordinates are (30,30). All players near the area of impact, regardless of which team they are on, will take damage. Catapults can be destroyed by the enemy team using a flint & steel or an explosive potion. A toolkit can fix a broken catapult. A catapult that is on fire may be put out with a bucket of water. A good tactic with the catapult is to simply continue firing the catapult at coordinates (0,0). Be careful when using the catapult, because it is possible to harm and even kill your own team-mates with it, so be on the look out for renegade flying rocks!

### Stepping stones
These are located in the north-east and south-west points of the river. Players can jump from stepping stone to stepping stone to cross the river in the middle of the arena. The stepping stones have many uses—one main use is to escape the enemy team while capturing the flag. If the flag is dropped while standing on stepping stones, it returns to the base. Players were once able to evade Ancient Magicks ice spells by crossing these stepping stones, but this was changed so that bind spells now prevent you from crossing the stones.

### Collapsible rocks
The collapsible rocks are located in the caves below the arena. Using a pickaxe or an explosive potion, players may collapse the walls and fill the cave passageway with rocks, so that players may not pass. To get past the collapsed rocks, players must use either two explosive potions or a pickaxe or both. If rocks are collapsed on top of a player, they will die immediately. This is an excellent trick if you are running through the tunnels with the flag, as it gets rid of many chasers and blocks the rest, but they could also kill you. The best trick to use is when it's clear, put a barricade on one side of you and put one under you. Therefore, the player doesn't see it under you, and when they go to attack you they actually attack the barricade, and then, you can use an explosive potion on the wall, killing them.

#### Some useful tactics:
A player bring a Dragon spear; another player has an explosive potion. The player with a dragon spear uses its special to push someone into the rockslide area. Another player then collapses the area.
Placing a barricade beneath you negates any dragon spear effect on you from another player from the opposing team.
If there is a barricade beneath you while a player tries to cross, he will be trapped in the rockslide area, which you can either immediately collapse or slowly mine.

In the caves, the most popular cave tunnel is the one on the right when coming down the ladder in a castle. The least popular is the one on the left.
The battle tactics in castle wars vary. Most of the time, each team will have at least one wielder of Ancient Magic. The ancient is often used to defend the castle from potential flag stealers by freezing them with ice spells. Once frozen, this gives the Melee people a chance to finish off the helpless thieves. Sometimes, ancients will also have a dual ranging fight skill where they will freeze someone then range them. Ancients are also useful underground for stopping flag capturers as they try to infiltrate the castle from the underground passages.

Most of the time, however, people choose to use Melee because it is inexpensive rather than spending money on buying runes or arrows. This is typical because most rangers or ancients in the game waste runes very fast—this proves to be an issue because of how expensive most ancient or high level spells are.

Mages and rangers tend to hang on the top of the castle near the catapult where they can see enemies storming the castle. They can then strike down potential threats from the safety of the wall. This, however, may not last long if a powerful warrior shows up on the wall. They will attack the mages and rangers, taking them down quickly because of their low Defence due to robes and dragonhide armour. Enough mages or rangers can quickly take the melee player down, though.

Lower-level players tend to stay in the underground with a pickaxe and collapse the tunnels with explosive potions and their pickaxes. Normally, they will wait for the person to walk under the tunnel when trying to attack them and then collapse the tunnel, instantly killing the other player.

Other methods such as ranging them in order to lure them under the tunnel or using an ancient spell to trap them under the tunnel have been used, although not as often due to expenses. As for flag-defending, most people barricade the flag and the exit so that when a flag capturer comes, they are trapped and quickly killed. Sometimes if players are quick enough in the beginning, they may be able to capture the opposing teams flag room and defend it for the whole game taking the flag when it shows back up from a score. This may sometimes backfire if a low-level player takes the flag. When this happens, the other team will allow the player to leave the castle then take him down and take their flag and hold it. This may cause the defeat of the flag-room raiding team.

#### The Teams
To join a team, either enter the red portal (for Zamorak, God of Chaos) or the blue portal (for Saradomin, God of Wisdom). There is a possibility that the team you are trying to enter has too many people, so to keep the teams balanced, you may not join it at that time. However, if you enter the green portal (for Guthix, God of Balance, you are included in the team with either the fewest number of people, or the lowest score.

### Waiting area
Once you join a team, you have to wait in an underground cavern until the next game starts. The Time remaining till the next game begins is displayed near the top of the screen in white print. The time to wait is always five minutes longer than the current game lasts, so if a game have 12 minutes left, the time to wait in the waiting area is 17 minutes. When a game has just finished, the next game will start in five minutes. If you need to leave, you can do so through the portal of the god's colour located inside the waiting area. Also, if you wear an item associated with a particular god in the opposite god's room, you will be turned into either a sheep (if entering Guthix), rabbit (if entering Saradomin) or imp (if entering Zamorak) for the duration of your stay in the waiting room (you will be transformed back to your regular form for the game itself).

## Development Notes
- Map will actually be instanced, separate from the Gielinor World to regulate server TPS & to sustain a focus for maximum performance in the mini-game itself.
- NPCs can be used to fixate player count, replace AFK players, or create completely observable games that players can make bets on.
- Tickets should be track-able - god forbid we actually lose them if they exist someplace.

### Positions (NPC Logic)
- Attackers: Players who storm the enemy castle either to attack other players or try to capture the flag and bring it back to their own castle.
- Defenders: Players who defend the flag on the 3rd floor or 4th floor keeping the enemies from getting a point. Those with freeze spells make good defenders as they can freeze opponents trying to run upstairs. Barricaders may also fall into this category.
- Archers: Players that are located on the outer wall near the catapult that attack incoming enemies players. They may either be rangers or mages.
- Medics: Players who use potions to heal other players.
- Catapulters: Players who attack incoming enemies using the catapult.
- Door men: Players who keep on closing the door on incoming enemies stopping them from coming in and leaving.
- Barricades or Engineers: Players who set up barricades slowing enemy players down from taking the flag.
- Miners: Players who go down in the dungeon and clear the way for their team and setting up collapsible rocks on the enemies. They may also try to repeatedly collapse rocks on team mates.
- Flag holder: A player who grabs their own flag after an enemy player has dropped it outside their castle and then holds on to it. This player should have a high Defence level and be experienced in Combat.
