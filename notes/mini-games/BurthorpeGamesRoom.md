# Burthorpe Games Room
A room where players can compete in various board games.

## Location & Travel
The Burthorpe Games Room is a minigame area located under Burthorpe Castle in Burthorpe. Players can teleport there using a games necklace, or by using the Minigame Group Finder interface. A branch of The Toad and Chicken pub is located by the entrance, Sam and Rachael both sell glasses of beer: Asgarnian ale, Wizard's mind bomb, and Dwarven stout for 2 coins each.

### Games
The games in the Burthorpe Games Room are quite common brain-teasing puzzle games, such as Othello, Reversi, Checkers, and Connect Four. They are played with one person at a time, and the player can be challenged to any of the four games via the lobby. However, at the end of each game, the player is placed in a room in which they can only challenge their opponent to another match of the previous game; making it so you must return to the main room prior to challenging them to a different game.

Games:
| Game | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Draughts/Checkers | Like real checkers, the object of the game is to 'jump' over all of your opponent's pieces. |
| Connect-Four | Each player must click a column, which will drop their rune to the bottom-most empty space in that column. A player wins when they connects four of his runes diagonally or in a straight line. |
| Reversi | The goal is to have more of your runes on the board than your opponent. You can take your opponents pieces by trapping them between your own. |
| Dots and Boxes | Each player fills in white line segments. If a player closes a box (their line completes a 1x1 square), that player's rune appears in the box. The player then gets another turn to place another segment. The game ends when all boxes are filled, and the player with the most filled-in squares is the winner. |
| Black-ack | Try to acquire cards with a face value as close as possible to 21 without going over. |
| Uno | Players take turns matching a card in their hand with the current card shown on top of the deck either by color or number. Special action cards deliver game-changing moments as they help you defeat your opponents. |
