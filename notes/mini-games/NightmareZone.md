# Nightmare Zone

## Description
The Nightmare Zone is a combat-based minigame that is located north of Yanille, northwest of the bank. The minigame involves players having "dreams" to fight bosses they have fought before in quests. It is run by Dominic Onion, who is a mage from Lunar Isle. This minigame is safe, meaning you will not lose items on death; however, any items you drop manually on the ground will be lost if you die, as you will be taken away from the arena. 

### Travel & Location
The Nightmare Zone is located north of the north-east entrance to Yanille and may be accessed via a number of ways:

Using the teleport option located in the mini-game tab, which is the fastest way of getting there. 
Casting Watchtower Teleport and walking east. 
Casting Teleport to House when your house is in Yanille, or re-directing a teleport to house tablet to Yanille using the Scroll of redirection. 
Using fairy ring code CLS and walking north-west[?], or CIQ and walking through Yanille. 
Using a Ring of dueling to teleport to Castle Wars, then walking to Yanille. 
Using the spirit tree to teleport to Tree Gnome Village and walking from there. 
Using the Ardougne cloak 1 to teleport to the Monastery and walking south.
