# Nightmare Zone

## Description
The Nightmare Zone is a combat-based minigame that is located north of Yanille, northwest of the bank. The minigame involves players having "dreams" to fight bosses they have fought before in quests. It is run by Dominic Onion, who is a mage from Lunar Isle. This minigame is safe, meaning you will not lose items on death; however, any items you drop manually on the ground will be lost if you die, as you will be taken away from the arena. 

### Travel & Location
The Nightmare Zone is located north of the north-east entrance to Yanille and may be accessed via a number of ways:

Using the teleport option located in the mini-game tab, which is the fastest way of getting there. 
Casting Watchtower Teleport and walking east. 
Casting Teleport to House when your house is in Yanille, or re-directing a teleport to house tablet to Yanille using the Scroll of redirection. 
Using fairy ring code CLS and walking north-west, or CIQ and walking through Yanille. 
Using a Ring of dueling to teleport to Castle Wars, then walking to Yanille. 
Using the spirit tree to teleport to Tree Gnome Village and walking from there. 
Using the Ardougne cloak 1 to teleport to the Monastery and walking south.

### Playing
The minigame requires coins to be put into the coffer. Coins can be deposited into and withdrawn from the coffer in multiples of 1000, to a maximum of 2,147,483,000 coins. The amount of coins needed for each mode varies according to the type of mode respectively: 
- Practice mode is free, requiring no coins. 
- Endurance mode requires 1,000 coins for normal mode, and 5,000 coins for hard mode. 
- Rumble mode requires 2,000 coins for normal mode, and 6,000 coins for hard mode. 
- Customisable rumbles requires 22,000 coins for normal mode, and 26,000 coins for hard mode. Players who have the maximum amount of quest points will have the cost reduced by 10,000 coins.

### Game modes
Two players participating in a rumble.
There are 3 modes of play in Nightmare Zone as follows: practice, endurance, and rumble. 
All modes have a 'Normal' or 'Hard' difficulty which can be applied. 
- Normal - In normal mode, quest monsters are fought at the original levels they were at in their respective quests. 
- Hard - Hard mode doubles the hitpoints, attack, strength, magic, and ranged levels of the bosses where applicable. Their defensive stats remain unchanged. 

Once the player chooses a mode to participate in, money is deducted from the coffer, and Dominic prepares the Dream potion on a plinth, which when drank will bring you into the Nightmare Zone arena. Those who wish to spectate can drink the spectator potion and enter the name of the player whom they wish to spectate. 
You do not need to bring the required quest items needed to finish off bosses; for example, the Black Knight Titan will die without the use of Excalibur, and items such as Magic secateurs will be provided for Tanglefoot and an Anti-dragon shield for Elvarg, and runes will be provided for Chronozon and the Dagannoth mother. 
NOTE If you log out inside the arena you will log in outside of the Dream World. 

#### Practice
Players can select a single boss which you have previously defeated in a quest to fight 1-on-1 until either boss or player dies. No experience is given and no Nightmare Zone points will be awarded for defeating the boss. Drops, such as Dragon Bones from Elvarg, WILL be awarded on defeat of the boss. 

#### Endurance
Fighting every boss the player has unlocked 1-on-1 in waves until the player either dies or defeats all bosses available, gaining Points for each boss defeated (see Points Awarded in the 'Bosses' section below). 

#### Rumble
This mode allows you (or a group of friends) to fight multiple randomly generated bosses at once and when you kill any single boss another one will spawn in its place endlessly until the player dies. This mode requires all players in the group to have the coins required for participating. Bosses encountered in a rumble are those that all players in the group can access. Reward points are rewarded for boss kills (points split between teams, see 'Bosses' section Note)

The interface for customisable rumble dreams.
To start a rumble, one player must speak to Dominic and he/she must invite participating players within the enclosure. Those that leave the enclosure will automatically leave the group. Once the hosting player drinks the Dream potion, players in the group will be prompted to either join the shared dream or leave the group. 
It can last six hours in rumble mode if you don't die within it. 
As of 10 March 2016, players can select their own set of bosses within the dream by selecting the customisable options after selecting Rumble mode. Customisable dreams require 22,000 coins for normal mode, and 26,000 coins for hard mode. Players who have the maximum amount of quest points will have the cost reduced by 10,000 coins. However, points obtained within customisable rumbles are reduced compared to that of regular rumbles, depending on how many bosses you remove. Having another player who has fewer quests completed host the rumble does not increase points gained. 

##### Power-ups
A player using the Zapper power-up in Rumble mode.
In Rumble mode, there are power-ups that spawn somewhere in the arena randomly and gives a player a temporary advantage against the bosses within the arena. There are four power-ups, each with an individual colour denoting its use: 
- Recurrent damage - Red in colour, using this power-up deals extra damage whenever you hit. The extra damage does NOT give exp. The extra damage is dependent on your initial damage, damaging the monster 3/4 of the initial damage. For example, hitting a 35 will deal an extra 26 damage upon the monster. This power-up lasts 45 seconds. 
- Zapper - Purple in colour, using this power-up damages nearby monsters. The zapper won't damage bosses that are immune to normal attacks (such as the Dagannoth Mother and Tanglefoot). This seems to have a max hit of 8. This power-up lasts 1 minute. 
- Power surge - Yellow in colour, using this power-up fills the user's special attack bar and regenerates it by 20% per tick. This power-up lasts 45 seconds. 
- Ultimate force - White in colour, using this power-up instantly kills all the bosses that are present in the arena. Points will NOT be gained for killing bosses in this manner 
    - These kills will, however, count towards your Slayer task (if applicable) and grant Slayer experience as long as you dealt some damage to your assigned monster within the Nightmare Zone. 
Power-ups disappear if they are not activated within 1 minute.

#### Bosses
The following table details the list of monsters that can be encountered within the Nightmare Zone; the more quests a player has completed, the more a player has access to. In Rumble mode, the only bosses that appear are those that all participating players have access to. 
Note: Point values increase based on the number of bosses included. These points are the maximum points that can be given (assumes ALL quests have been completed and ALL bosses included, not just those required for bosses below). If you are in a team, points are split between those who attacked the monster. The person who did the most damage will take a larger percentage of the maximum points from that monster. 
Also of note is that many bosses provide an increased Experience amount per damage dealt, such as Dad, Moss Giant, Arrg, Slagilith, and the Ice Troll King.

#### Rewards
The rewards for the Nightmare Zone are contained in a chest near Dominic Onion, and the rewards are split into three categories: Resources, Upgrades, and Benefits. These rewards can be purchased using Reward points obtained inside the minigame. A maximum of 2,147,483,647 points may be stored in the chest at once. 

##### Resources
Resources include certain Herblore ingredients, elemental runes, and items that are only obtainable via the minigame, such as scrolls of redirection. 
Note: The only item Ironman mode accounts may buy from the resources tab of the shop are scrolls of redirection. 
*All players can only purchase 15 herb boxes per day. 

##### Upgrades
Upgrades can imbue certain items for reward points, increasing stats. The imbued black mask and slayer helmet enhances Magic and Ranged accuracy and damage to assigned Slayer targets. The imbued Fremennik rings increase stats, and imbued crystal equipment will not have its stats lowered as it degrades. For crystal equipment, each charge costs an additional 2,000 points to imbue; 2,000 points for 1/10 and 20,000 points for an unused one. 
Imbuing it will add an (i) to its name and will have an "Uncharge" option. The uncharge option removes the imbued bonus, and will refund 80% of the points back. Dying will cause your imbued item to lose its charges, and the player will have to obtain the points again to imbue it. 

##### Benefits
Benefits include certain potions that can only be used within the minigame. Dominic's potions are sold by the dose. When you purchase a dose, it is automatically stored in the barrels until the player withdraws them. All Nightmare Zone potions, excluding overloads due to the damage dealt, can be drank extremely quickly, and like combo foods, you can actually drink 28 absorptions at the speed of cleaning an inventory of herbs, by clicking on them one by one, this can also be done with food/other potions with Nightmare Zone potions, without delaying any hits
